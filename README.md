Census Program Transformation Project I worked on during my summer 2019 internship at Statistics Canada.

- During my summer term at Statistics Canada, I used administrative data from the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and compared consistency of addresses with Census data.

- The main tools I used for my analysis were R and SAS.
